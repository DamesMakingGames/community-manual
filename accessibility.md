# Accessibility

The DMG workshop and office space is situated within the Toronto Media Arts Centre, a major facility for nonprofits offering public event and exhibition spaces and offices for its member groups.

[Information about the accessibility of the TMAC facility](https://toronto-media-arts-centre.gitbook.io/procedure-manual/policies/accessibility), including washrooms.

DMG is on the 3rd floor of the building. As of October 2018, the main elevator does not service the 3rd floor. There is a secondary elevator in another area of the building, however, it requires the ascent of three stairs to access. We expect the main elevator to be repaired by December 2018.

The door to the DMG workshop space is 48" wide and is propped open before and during events. The workshop space itself is barrier free.
