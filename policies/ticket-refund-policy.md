## Cancelations

If you have reserved a free DMG member ticket for a paid event and are unable to make it, please [cancel your registration](https://dmg.to/members/registrations) so that another member can attend.

Doing so means more people have access to our programming, and ensures we start events on time!

If you have paid for a registration and cancel more than 2 weeks prior to the start of an event, you are eligible for a full refund. **Please [contact us](mailto:events@dmg.to) to initiate the refund process – it is not automatic.**

### Refunds and Exchanges

In general, we are unable to provide refunds or exchanges for registrations canceled less than 2 weeks prior to the start of the course or workshop. However, this is not a hard-and-fast policy. If something comes up and you're unable to make it to an event you have a paid for, please [contact us](mailto:events@dmg.to) and we'll see what we can do.

The more notice you give us, the better chance we will be able to provide a refund or credit for a future event.

Absolutely no refunds will be given after the event.
