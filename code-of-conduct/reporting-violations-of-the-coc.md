# For Members/Participants

If you witness or are subject to unacceptable behavior, or experience marginalizing or silencing behavior that limits your full participation in any DMG event, please talk to any of the following people:

- The host of the event you are attending (listed on the event page)
- Any DMG volunteer, staff person, or director

Your conversation will be held in confidence.

When you come to us with a problem during an event, it is our top priority to help you feel safe as quickly as possible. Next, if you agree, a small group of community organizers and members will meet to decide what our response will be in accordance with our written conflict resolution policy. Then, we will warn or remove the offender depending on the circumstances, taking your and the community's safety and wishes into account. If the problem does not impact your human rights or safety, we may ask the involved parties to leave the event and schedule a time to engage in negotiation and mediation at a later date.

Community‭ ‬organizers‭ ‬are‭ ‬available‭ ‬to‭ ‬help‭ you ‬engage‭ ‬with‭ ‬local‭ ‬law‭ ‬enforcement (solely at your request).

# For Staff/Organizers

## Receiving Reports

Collect a written account, or transcribe verbal report. Gather this information from the reporter – do not "interview" witnesses unless they approach staff:

    - Name of the participant doing the harassing
    - The behavior that was in violation
    - The date and time of the behavior
    - The circumstances surrounding the incident
    - Other people involved in the incident

### Response

**DO:**
- …assess immediate threat to safety or wellbeing of participants
- …allow the reporter a chance to decide if any further action is taken:
    - **"This sounds like a breach of our Code of Conduct. If you're OK with it, I am going to meet with a small group of people and figure out what our response will be."** Pause, and see if they say they do not want this. Otherwise, go ahead.

**DO NOT:**
- …ask for their advice on how to deal with the complaint
- …offer them input into penalties
- …share details of the people involved or incident without specific permission from the victim. This includes sharing with other staff
- …involve law enforcement or security unless the victim explicitly requests that you do so – unless there is a threat to other people's physical safety
