# For Members/Participants

If you witness or are subject to unacceptable behavior, or experience marginalizing or silencing behavior that limits your full participation in any DMG event, please talk to any of the following people:

- The host of the event you are attending (listed on the event page)
- Any DMG volunteer, staff person, or director

Your conversation will be held in confidence.

When you come to us with a problem during an event, it is our top priority to help you feel safe as quickly as possible. Next, if you agree, a small group of community organizers and members will meet to decide what our response will be in accordance with our written conflict resolution policy. Then, we will warn or remove the offender depending on the circumstances, taking your and the community's safety and wishes into account. If the problem does not impact your human rights or safety, we may ask the involved parties to leave the event and schedule a time to engage in negotiation and mediation at a later date.

Community‭ ‬organizers‭ ‬are‭ ‬available‭ ‬to‭ ‬help‭ you ‬engage‭ ‬with‭ ‬local‭ ‬law‭ ‬enforcement (solely at your request).

# For Staff/Organizers

## Receiving Reports

Collect a written account, or transcribe verbal report. Gather this information from the reporter – do not "interview" witnesses unless they approach staff:

    - Name of the participant doing the harassing
    - The behavior that was in violation
    - The date and time of the behavior
    - The circumstances surrounding the incident
    - Other people involved in the incident

### Response

If an issue is reported during an event, first assess the nature and severity of the violation.
    - If anyone's physical safety is threatened, immediately remove the offender from the venue and contact law enforcement.
    - If it is an interpersonal issue and not a clear violation of the Code of Conduct, refer the reporter to the [Conflict Resolution Policy](/policies/conflict-resolution-policy.md) and offer the support of the CR committee.
    - If the offender is engaged in sustained or repeat violations of the Code of Conduct and has been warned, ask them to leave the venue immediately.
    - In all other cases:
2. Provide the victim a private place to sit, and offer to fetch a friend to sit with them.
3. Allow the victim a chance to decide if any further action is taken: "This sounds like a breach of our Code of Conduct. **If you're OK with it,** I am going to meet with a small group of people and figure out what our response will be." Pause, and see if they say they do not want this. Otherwise, go ahead.
4. Let them know that the conflict resolution ("CR") committee will handle the matter according to DMG policies, and walk them through the steps. Let them know that the CR team will keep them in the loop about any actions taken.
5. Make sure they know that their identity will not be disclosed to anyone – including the offender – except the CR team.


**DO NOT** ask the victim for advice on how to deal with the complaint.
**DO NOT** offer the victim input into penalties.
**DO NOT** share details of the people involved or incident without specific permission from the victim. This includes sharing with other staff.
**DO NOT** involve law enforcement or security unless the victim explicitly requests that you do so, or if there is a threat to other people's physical safety.

### Incident Report

When an issue is reported, whether it is referred to the conflict resolution policy or considered a Code of Conduct violation, the CR committee should complete a written report covering:

* Who, when, where, how was the incident originally reported?
* Who received the report?
* When and where did the reported incident happen?
* Who was involved?
* Description of the incident: What happened? Who was impacted?
* What action will be taken? Who will meet with the offender and victim?
* If the offender has been warned, how did they respond? Were they humble and contrite? Did they immediately stop the behavior?
* Document every communication from staff or committee members related to the incident, especially to third parties, and justify them.
* Document the date of the CR committee meeting(s) and any decisions and follow-up communications related to the incident.


### Committee Meeting

Members of the CR committee should meet as soon as possible after a report – ideally within one week – to discuss:

* What happened?
* What are we doing about it?
* Who is doing those things?
* When are they doing them?

Neither the complainant nor the alleged harasser should attend, even if they are a member of staff, the CR committee, or a director.

Before or during the above meeting, let the alleged harasser know that there is a complaint about them. Give them the opportunity to  tell a member of the committee their side of the story, and if they do, have that person take it into the meeting.

After the meeting, let the harasser know what action is being taken. Say, "If you'd like to discuss this further, please contact \[x\], but in the meantime, you must \[x\]."


### Sanctions

#### About Apologies

Do not ask the offender to apologize to the victim. DMG has no responsibility to enforce friendship, reconciliation, or anything beyond stopping harassment between members or event attendees.

Forcing a victim of harassment to acknowledge an apology from their harasser forces further contact with their harasser. It also creates a social expectation that they will accept the apology, forgive their harasser, and return their social connection to its previous status.

If the harasser offers to apologize to the victim (especially in person), we suggest strongly discouraging it. If a staff member relays an apology to the victim, it should be brief and not require a response.

If the harasser attempts to press an apology on someone who would clearly prefer to avoid them, or attempts to recruit others to relay messages on their behalf, this constitutes continued harassment.
