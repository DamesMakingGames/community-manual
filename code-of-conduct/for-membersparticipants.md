# For Members/Participants

If you witness or are subject to unacceptable behavior, or experience marginalizing or silencing behavior that limits your full participation in any DMG event, please talk to any of the following people:

- The host of the event you are attending (listed on the event page)
- Any DMG volunteer, staff person, or director

Your conversation will be held in confidence.

When you come to us with a problem during an event, it is our top priority to help you feel safe as quickly as possible.

Next, if you agree, a small group of community organizers and members will meet to decide what our response will be in accordance with our written conflict resolution policy.

Then, we will warn or remove the offender depending on the circumstances, taking your and the community's safety and wishes into account.

If the problem is not harassing, and does not impact your human rights or safety, we may ask the involved parties to leave the event and schedule a time to engage in a conflict resolution process at a later date.

Community‭ ‬organizers‭ ‬are‭ ‬available‭ ‬to‭ ‬help‭ you ‬engage‭ ‬with‭ ‬local‭ ‬law‭ ‬enforcement (solely at your request, unless the physical safety of someone else is threatened).
