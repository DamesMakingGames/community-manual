# Glossary


## Advisory group
An ex-officio body of 3 to 4 persons, external to the Board of Directors, with professional expertise to provide advice on addressing complaints, particular formal complaints as per section 2. 

## Conflict

An ongoing experience of varying degrees of tension, usually involving multiple events, and misunderstandings, possibly leading to the building up of layers of interpersonal discord. This policy uses both “conflict” and “dispute” without necessarily distinguishing between the 2 terms, since most people do not give them different meanings. Mediation processes will make the distinction as needed. 

## Conflict Resolution Committee

A standing committee of the Board to which unresolved formal complaints are sent for review and recommendations, as per 2.07.2 or 2.08.4 below. The ED will sit ex-officio on the subcommittee unless restricted as per 1.04 or 2.03. The committee will designate a staff liaison for the purpose of serving as a Responsible Contact Person, as per 1.04 and 2.03. 

## Complainant
The individual lodging a complaint against another DMG-related individual, policy or practice. 

## Discipline
The corrective action taken in respect to an individual, as a consequence of a formal complaint. Disciplinary measures are normally considered confidential, and the details are usually not shared with other parties to the conflict, except when considered necessary to advise other organizations or safeguard the public. 

## Disputes
Specific disagreements between or among people on a particular topic. This policy uses both “conflict” (see above) and “dispute” without necessarily distinguishing between the 2 terms, since most people do not give them different meanings. Effective mediation processes will make the distinction as needed. 

## Internal advisor
An individual who has been appointed by the Board to act as an intermediary, convening authority, facilitator and/or mediator in the conflict resolution process, and to work with the parties to achieve a satisfactory outcome. The Board will annually appoint one or more Internal Advisors, the appointments of which may be from the Board, the staff, or the general membership based on training, experience, and neutrality. 

## Respondent
An individual against whom a complaint has been made, and/or someone responsible for the policy or activity complained about. 

## Responsible contact people
Those who are accountable at DMG for assisting in conflict resolution and addressing of formal complaints. They do not act as advocates for any party in the conflict. Their role is a neutral implementer of the policy. The assignments to this role are listed in the procedures below. 

## Support people
Individuals not connected to the conflicts or disputes being addressed, which either the complainant or respondent may choose to have in attendance at mediation meetings.
