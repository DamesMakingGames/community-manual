DMG strives to provide a space free from linguistic, physical, environmental and social barriers. 

We ask that everyone part of this community, but especially workshop leaders and speakers at our events, be:

- **Intentional** in their speech
- **Aware** of the words they use and the effect they may have on others
- **Humble** (not defensive) when corrected or questioned

It can be difficult at first to change language habits, but we are a community that values a genunine intent to include and affirm all experiences and bodies. If you realize you've said something you wish you hadn't, correct yourself and move on. You'll be afforded patience and also remind others about our commitment to eliminating ableism in our space.

The following words and phrases are often used pejoratively to oppress, other, or marginalize disabled people. Many of these words, common in casual speech, are derived from descriptions of disability. Do your best to be aware of your use of these terms, and change the language you use to avoid unintentionally hurting someone.
