# Mentor and Volunteer Guidelines

Thank you for volunteering to mentor! Whether or not this is your first time helping out at DMG this way, please take a moment to read through these guidelines. 

*DMG is an explicitly feminist space. It is critical that all mentors and volunteers strive to take an intersectional approach to supporting the experiences of participants in our programs. While we greatly value the contributions of the many cis and trans men who support DMG, we prioritize cis and trans women, genderqueer, femme, nonbinary and Two Spirit individuals in our space and in our mentor and volunteer programs.*

## What is my role during the program?

- You are an **adviser** and a **resource** — _not_ a teacher or instructor.
- You help participants solve their own problems.
- You lend your experience and insight so new game makers can focus on the parts of the process they find most interesting and valuable.

**Expect to learn as much from the participants as they will learn from you.**

- Mentors are, without exception, active and trusted members of the DMG and/or Gamma Space communities. Everything we know about being a good mentor we learned from you at our previous programs, and owe a huge debt of gratitude to each of you for setting the tone for a truly supportive and collaborative community.

## What is a DMG immersive?

It’s _not_ a "learn to program" course. We _don’t_ just teach a specific development environment or language, or how to make a certain type of game. We _do_ provide:

- A crash course in/survey of a wide range of technical and creative aspects of game-making (design principles, composing, visual art, project management, and more)
- A game design vocabulary and opportunities to develop literacy around play
- A safe and uncritical place to talk about what games mean to us
- A structured environment for individuals to find and express their creative voice and discover what interests them most about making games
- A time and place for participants to learn from and support one another

## Understanding DMG's goals and values

DMG is a member organization that **values** collaborative learning, free self-expression, affirmation and creation.

We do not tolerate destructive, exclusionary, abusive, or silencing behavior.

Our **goals** include:

- Providing space and opportunities for our members to freely explore playing, critiquing and creating games
- Demonstrating the value of diversity in a broad range of disciplines related to games
- Highlighting the achievements of diverse gamemakers
- Increasing the diversity of expression in all aspects of game culture

Please read and affirm our [inclusiveness statement](https://dmg.to/inclusiveness), and talk to an organizer if you are confused about anything.

## Understanding the goals of an immersive

Our long programs are workshops that last four to six weeks with a set cohort of participants selected through an application process. The group meets two to three times per week, and receives one-on-one mentorship for the duration of the program, and six months beyond. The purpose of our long programs is to:

- Create a friendly, open, collaborative experience for participants
- Provide a safe and playful space for exploring creative ideas, as well as learning problem-solving and technical skills
- Facilitate meaningful connections between participants and more experienced members of the DMG and Toronto game communities
- Expose established members of the community to valuable new perspectives
- Create makers, mentors, collaborators, and friends out of everyone involved!

## Who are you mentoring?

Long program participants come from a **wide variety of backgrounds** and have a range of skills, interests and knowledge. Get to know them!

## Inclusive Language and Behavior

It is critical that a safe, stress-free and inclusive environment is maintained at all times. Here’s how you can do your part:

### Respect Diverse Identities

- Do not make assumptions about identity, experiences, or preferred pronouns
- Always use a person's preferred pronouns.
- Allow participants space and time to disclose as much or as little information about their identity and background as they wish.
- Treat all participants with respect and assume they know more about what they are trying to create than you do.

### Respect Space and Agency

#### Do not touch or take the keyboard away. The keyboard is _lava!_

- Grabbing someone's keyboard can be off-putting, scary, and demoralizing
- Give clear directions and let participants do their own work – **if you're frustrated by the speed a participant is learning, you're in the wrong place**
- If you absolutely must type something **(chances are you don't)**, ask "May I?”, go slow and explain what you are doing

#### Sexual jokes, remarks, and advances are never funny or appropriate

#### Focus on the participants

- Be available and attentive to participants throughout the work session.
- Stay on the sidelines, but monitor facial expressions and moods - ask "What are you struggling with?" if someone looks frustrated.
- Avoid in-jokes and lengthy private conversations with other mentors - this can be alienating. Include participants in casual conversations.

### Respectful Critique and Discussion



- Always find something positive to say about the game: _Help participants recognize their own successes, and take the time to let them show you._
- Don't say "no" - say, "You're heading in the right direction" or, "Yes, and…"
- On the same note, don't use negative language to describe the game (i.e. that it "doesn't work," "is broken," etc.) but rather suggest potential improvements
- Help articulate a problems by asking what they're hoping to learn from the process or if there are any particular points they want to clarify.
- Avoid comparing their game to existing games (“This is just like \[x]!”) - this can be discouraging. Rather, share examples of games that are visually or mechanically distinct to demonstrate a concept they are trying to achieve.
- Rather than "This doesn't make sense," say "I'm having trouble understanding" or "Can you clarify?"
- Try to find and respect the core idea of the game and understand its style, even if it's something that doesn't appeal to you personally
- Don't suggest that participants drastically alter their mechanics; help them improve on the game they've chosen to make.
- **Encourage questions, and respond to them positively**
	- Ask "What questions do you have?" (not "Do you have any questions?") and respond positively:
		- What an interesting question! / I've wondered that myself! / I'm glad you brought that up!

## Thanks!
