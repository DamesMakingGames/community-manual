# How to Present at a Speaker Social

## Who presents at DMG Speaker Socials?

Any trans or cis woman, genderqueer, nonbinary or Two Spirit individual with a project related to interactive/immersive media art, computer or analog games!

You don't have to have created a polished, released game - even a sketch of an idea is interesting and we'd love to hear about it. We are interested all kinds of media artworks, computer and digital games – whether you're in a technical or non-technical role, a producer or support person, focused on music or art or narrative. Maybe you're not working on a game at all, but a writer, artist, musician producing work that game makers would be interested in or inspired by. We want you!

## What's it like to give a presentation at a DMG event?

All **Speaker Socials** happen at our headquarters, Gamma Space, located at [862 Richmond Street West](http://goo.gl/maps/jTmW8) in Toronto. It's a coworking space during the day, and also hosts events and meetups in the evening.

You'll have access to a projector and screen, a microphone and sound board - and all the cables you could possibly need! Arrive at least 15 minutes before the start of the social, and we'll get you all set up. _If you need other specialized equipment, please let us know ahead of time._

The crowd is usually about 25-50 strong and a mix of indie developers, designers, artists, people who work at small studios, freelancers, enthusiasts and more. A large proportion of the crowd comes from a non-technical background. The mood is casual, supportive, sociable and friendly. 

Presentations should be roughly 20 minutes long (shorter if more than three people are presenting, longer if you need more time and we've made special arrangements). Having some kind of visual component - slides or a demo of your game - is ideal. 

## What should I talk about?

A good standard format is:

### 1. Intro

_You, your background, and how you're involved with DMG if applicable_

People want to know about you! What interests, skills, hobbies, and communities influence your work; why you're interested in games; what brought you to DMG (if you're a participant in a DMG program or new to the community). If your career path or area of study is related to games or influenced your project, say a few words about how you wound up there.

### 2. Project Background

_Tell the story of your project and how it came to be._

* Where did the idea come from? 
* Were you influenced by other related games or projects? 
* What challenges did you meet along the way? Did the project change as it progressed? 
* If you have any interesting anecdotes about the process, tell them!

### 3. Demo/Presentation

_Show us what you've got!_

If your project is a game, play through a small part of it on screen. Point out the parts you're most proud of or interested in. 

If you're presenting on a topic, take us through some visuals. Slides with minimal text and graphics/photos work best!

### 4. Pitch/ask-the-audience
_Ask the audience a question and get feedback on a problem you're struggling with_

If you have future plans for growing or changing the project, talk about what they are. Looking for help or collaborators? Send out a call! A great way to lead in to a lively Q+A session is to ask attendees for feedback about a specific aspect of your project. This could be about game design ("What do you think is most unique about this design?"), the interface ("How do I make the actions available to the player more clear?"), research ("Who's doing interesting work that I should check out?"), collaboration ("I'm looking for a sound designer…") - or any other issue you're wondering about!

## What makes for an engaging presentation?

**Enthusiasm** Avoid self-deprecating phrases or apologizing for the state of your demo ("It's a work in progress" is better than "it's not done yet," for example). Assume that the audience is excited to hear what you have to say - because they are.

**Confidence** Remember that there will be people in the audience who are less experienced than you — your work may be the motivation they need to make their first game or get involved with the community. You have skills and experience and interesting ideas - you never know who or what you might inspire.

**Openness** Sharing the difficult parts of your process, the setbacks and failures, make your work relatable. And asking for feedback or help on a specific component lets the audience contribute and get involved in your project in small way that just might lead to a breakthrough. No one is expecting pure brilliance or a flawless demo - just cool dames working on interesting games!

**Inclusive language** DMG strives to provide a space as free as possible from linguistic and physical/environmental barriers and microagressions. We ask that everyone part of this community, but especially workshop leaders and speakers at our events, be intentional in their speech, aware of the words they use and the effect they may have on attendees, and humble when corrected or questioned.

If you would like to practice ahead of time or rehearse your talk, we would be happy to arrange for you to do so ahead of time.

## A note about recording

We sometimes video and audio record speakers at our socials, with permission, and create edited videos and text transcripts of the presentations. We post these videos and articles on our site to broaden the reach of our programs beyond Toronto. Please let us know if you would prefer we did not record your presentation, or if you would like to see it before it is made public.

We can provide you with the source for the video, and you are free to post and share it however you like.
