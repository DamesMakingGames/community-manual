Here's what we typically need help with:

### Set up

* **Workshops/classes:** If more than 24 people are registered, set up 2 folding tables and 6 chairs at the back 
* **Lectures/presentations:** Move tables, take down power cables, and set up 40 folding chairs
* Get snacks (socials only, unless otherwise planned), set up food table and put out water bottles and glasses
* Put sandwich board sign out in front of building and prop doors with wedges (found on yellow table by front door)

### Greeting

* Have a volunteer check folks in. _To print registration list (admin only) go to the admin side event page, navigate to "Attendees" and hit the "Print" button._
* Help with equipment/laptops
* Introduce DMG before the instructor begins - who you are, a little about DMG and one or two upcoming events that may be of interest.

### Clean up

* Fold and put away chairs and folding tables, reattach power
* Put away laptops, power cables, mice, etc.
* Wipe down work tables and replace felt mats
* Sweep and wipe up any spills, dustbust up crumbs
* Take out garbage (kitchen and bathroom) and recycling
* Wipe kitchen counters, load and start dishwasher
* Close all windows, turn out the lights and lock the door
