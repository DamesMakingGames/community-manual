# DMG Toronto Community Documentation

## While we welcome everyone to our events and our space, **DMG is specifically for trans and cis women, genderqueer, nonbinary and Two Spirit people.**

DMG is an **explicitly feminist space**.

We **prioritize people who are traditionally marginalized** in tech and game spaces, especially those whom DMG specifically serves, as well as people who are racialized, neurodiverse, and/or have disabilities.

**We expect all of our members to do the same.**

## So, why are you here?

People join DMG for lots of different reasons. Here are a few of the kinds of people who are part of this organization:

* Students who need additional support and opportunities for learning outside the classroom
* Artists who enjoy the supportive, welcoming and stimulating environment DMG provides, even if theyâ€™re not creating games (yet!)
* Experienced game designers who want to contribute to the community
* People interested in developing technical and artistic skills, who want to hone their craft in an informal environment
* Anyone interested in exploring ways to express themselves creatively


One of our goals is to remove obstacles to our membersâ€™ success, and the best way you can help us do that is to think about what you hope to get out of DMG and contribute as a member. We ask these questions in your membership application, and look forward to talking to you about your aspirations at an event.
