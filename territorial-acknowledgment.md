# Territorial Acknowledgment

We encourage event organizers to acknowledge the territory the space we use is situated on, and to engage with it individually. Our board and community leadership commits to deepening our engagement with the decolonial project, humbly seeking conversations with Indigenous communities, and continually considering the purpose of and working to improve verbal acknowledgments.

> Gamma Space sits on land that is the territory of the Huron-Wendat and Petun First Nations, the Seneca, and most recently, the Mississaugas of the Credit River. The territory was the subject of the Dish With One Spoon Wampum Belt Covenant, an agreement between the Iroquois Confederacy and Confederacy of the Ojibwe and allied nations to share and care for the resources around the Great Lakes.

> Toronto is home to many Indigenous people from across Turtle Island and we are grateful to have the opportunity to work in the community, on this territory.
>
> We strive to center the experiences of Black, Indigenous and people of color, and give up space as part of our work towards redressing dispossession, oppression and the living legacy of racism.
